# Homework Five

In this homework we are going to build a Login form using React:

* The user will see the login form by default. You need to have a place for user to type user name and a place to type password in the form, as well as a login button for user to click.
* User can log in only if they use one of those combination described below:

```
// Suppose today is June 21, 2018

Username    Password
today       20180621
tomorrow    20180622
yesterday   20180620
```

* Note that the password for those three username will change based on what today's date is.
* If the user tries to login with a wrong username and password combination, you need to show a message in the UI to let the user know what happened.
* After login, you can show users a simple text to indicate that the user has been already logged in. Also you need to have a button for user to logout.
